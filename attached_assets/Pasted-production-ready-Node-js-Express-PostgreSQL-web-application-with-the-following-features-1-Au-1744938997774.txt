production‑ready Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL web application with the following features:

1. *Authentication*  
   - User registration (full name, email, password)  
   - User login/logout using express‑session and connect‑pg‑simple  
   - Passwords hashed with bcrypt  
   - On successful login, redirect to a protected page that displays “Hola Mundo, <username>”

2. *Database*  
   - Use PostgreSQL, with connection string provided below  
   - Use an ORM or query builder (e.g. Prisma, Drizzle or plain pg)  
   - Create a “users” table with id, name, email, password, created_at  

3. *Frontend*  
   - Simple HTML templates using EJS or Pug (your choice)  
   - Modern styling with Tailwind CSS via CDN  
   - A clean, responsive login and register form  
   - A protected “Dashboard” page showing “Hola Mundo, <username>” and a “Logout” button  

4. *Environment & Deployment*  
   - Include a .env.example with these variables (do not fill SECRET_KEY):  
     
     DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_3O1bjMnLrwdE@ep-dawn-glade-a4oz3y8p-pooler.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
     SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret_here
     PORT=3000
       
   - In code, read these via process.env  
   - Add a vercel.json and configure build and routes so it runs on Vercel out of the box  
   - Provide package.json scripts: "dev", "start", and a "vercel-build" if needed  

5. *Project Structure*  
   - package.json, .gitignore, .env.example  
   - server.js or app.js with Express setup, session middleware, and routes  
   - views/ folder with login.ejs, register.ejs, dashboard.ejs  
   - public/ folder for Tailwind imports, optional custom CSS/JS  

6. *Instructions*  
   - Include a README.md with setup steps:  
     1. Copy .env.example to .env and fill SESSION_SECRET  
     2. npm install  
     3. npm run dev (or vercel dev)  
     4. Deploy to Vercel  

Use the exact DATABASE_URL above. Ensure sessions persist across Vercel deployments. Make it as minimal as possible so that cloning, installing, and deploying on Vercel yields a running app with register/login and a “Hola Mundo” dashboard.
